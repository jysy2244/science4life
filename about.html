<p style = "font-size: 20px; margin-top: 70px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 30px;">Physics is the study of how objects move under the influence of specifics forces. <br> Classical mechanics is sometimes seen as a part of applied mathematics. <br>Kinetics is teh description of motion, while dynamics is the study of teh action of forces in producing either motion or static equilibrium. <br> The scope of pyhsics are: <br> Mechanics <br> The study of gravitation <br> thermodynamics mechanics <br> Newton's first law <br> Newton's second law <br> Newton's third law <br> and more </p> 

<p1 style = "color: darkorange; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px;  line-height: 30px;"> Mechanics is the area of physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. Forces applied to objects result in displacements, which are changes of an object's position relative to its environment. </p1>
<br>
<p2 style = "color: green; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> The theory of gravity states that every mass in the universe attracts every other object by an invisible force acting along the direction of the line joining both objects' centres of mass. </p2>
<br>
<p3 style = "color: red; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Newton's First Law of Motion (Inertia) An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. </p3>
<br>
<p4 style = "color: black ; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Newton's second law states that the acceleration of the body is directly proportional to the net force acting on the body and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. </p4>
<br>
<p5 style = "color: purple; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Newton's third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force on object B, object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. </p5>
