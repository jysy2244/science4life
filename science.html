<p style = "font-size: 20px; margin-top: 70px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 30px;">Chemistry is the science that studies the properties, content, and the structure (specified as elements and compounds), the changes they go through, and the energy released or absorbed during these processes. <br> The scope of chemistry: <br> Basic concepts (Atoms, Elements, Compounds, Chemical Reactions) <br> Organic Chemistry <br> Properties of Matter <br> Chemical Bonding and Structure <br> and more </p> 

<p1 style = "color: darkorange; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px;  line-height: 30px;"> Atom, the basic building block of all matter and chemistry. Atoms can combine with other atoms to form molecules but cannot be divided into smaller parts by ordinary chemical processes. </p1>
<br>
<p2 style = "color: green; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> An element is a substance made up of only one type of atom, each with the same number of protons.  </p2>
<br> 
<p3 style = "color: red; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> A compound is a substance made up of two or more different chemical elements combined in a fixed ratio. When the elements come together, they react with each other and form chemical bonds that are difficult to break. </p3>
<br>
<p4 style = "color: black ; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Chemical Reaction is the processes, in which a substance or substances undergo a chemical change to produce new substance or substances, with entire new properties,are known as chemical reactions.</p4>
<br>
<p5 style = "color: purple; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-containing compounds. </p5>
<br>
<p6 style = "color: green; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> Chemical properties are characteristics that can only be measured or observed as matter transforms into a particular type of matter.</p6>
<br>
<p7 style = "color: darkorange; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 50px; line-height: 30px;"> <br> A chemical bond is defined as the force of attraction which holds the constituents atom together in a molecule. Chemical bonding is basically the process of forming bonds between atoms and molecules.</p7>
